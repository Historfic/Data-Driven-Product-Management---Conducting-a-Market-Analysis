### Project Description
In this project, we'll be analyzing online search trends to identify opportunities for our fitness products in local and international markets. By leveraging data manipulation skills, we'll examine user interest in home gyms, gym workouts, and home workouts across different regions.  We'll then create data visualizations to uncover insights that can guide strategic product decisions and ensure we're catering to evolving fitness preferences.
Analyzes data from 2020, potentially reflecting pandemic influences, and compares the popularity of "workout" searches in general to searches for specific terms like "home workout" and "gym workout." It investigates geographic variations in workout interest by looking at countries like the United States, Australia, and Japan, and even drills down to compare interest in home workouts between the Philippines and Malaysia. By visualizing this search data, the project aims to identify patterns and inform decisions related to fitness products.
